# DDD

this repo is for the different parts of the disconnection data distribution project.
there should be an outline of the different modules, how they relate, and how they are run.

unfortunately, this layout doesn't interact well with IDEs that like to see projects at the root of the repo, so you will want to clone the DDD repo and then add the relevant subdirectories as projects in your IDE.

for example, BundleClient and BundleTransport are android projects that are used with android studio.
bundleserver is a maven project.

for more description about the project, here is a paper [EUC_2023_paper-3.pdf](https://github.com/SJSU-CS-systems-group/DDD/files/14874085/EUC_2023_paper-3.pdf) published in EUC 2023.
