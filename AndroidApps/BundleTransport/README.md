## FEATURES and HOW TO USE
The Bundle Transport has two main features:

2. Connect to the Bundle Server - Creates a request to the Bundle Server in order to upload and download the bundles

Look up bundle transport directory in Device Explorer ```/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.discdd.bundletransport```
